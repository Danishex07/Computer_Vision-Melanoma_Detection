# Malignant Melanoma Detection System

This MATLAB-based system is designed to discriminate between images of malignant melanoma and benign skin lesions. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to preprocess the images, extract relevant features, classify the lesions, and evaluate the performance of the classification.

Please run the main.m file.

System will take time to preprocess the images beacause of the hair removal algorithm.
A display message will appear in the command window displaying current progress of image by a number.
